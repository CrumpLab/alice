# alice
Minimal example for building a Semantic Librarian in R (Shiny)

This example loads in Alice and Wonderland as a text corpus, produces semantic vectors for the words and sentences, as well as any factors associated with each row of text.

The semantic vectors associated with each word, sentence, and factor can then be searched and visualized in a shiny app.

The repository contains the code necessary to build the example. The example shiny app that should be produced can be viewed here: [https://semanticlibrarian.shinyapps.io/alice/](https://semanticlibrarian.shinyapps.io/alice/)
